## Introduction

This project is cloned from [keycloak-gatekeeper](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-gatekeeper), and modified for using with ingress-nginx as [External Basic Authentication](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/external-auth/) not [External OAUTH Authentication](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/oauth-external-auth/).

The configuration is generally the same with keycloak-gatekeeper, so you can refer to [Gatekeeper documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_keycloak_generic_adapter).
